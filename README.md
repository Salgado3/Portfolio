# My Portfolio
Write a short sentence or two about this project and what it does. Be sure to include a link and a screenshot (we're front end devs so we can actually see our work!).

**Link to project:** https://salgado3.github.io/devJaimePortfolio/


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTML5 UP Design

Let me begin by saying, I am not a designer lol. I utilized a template from html5up.com to act a base to build upon. I was able to link my projects directly from github pages and photos from unsplash.com. The main photo is from the a trip I took to Guanajuato Mexico. I was at one of the highest peak of the state. The air was thin, the legs were shaky, but the views made the hike worth it. Anyways, I hope you you take some time to check it out (my portfolio..... and Guanajuato if you ever get the chance).


## Optimizations

This is an ongoing project. I will continue to add my top 6 projects (shout out to Myspace, remember that?) as I continue to build. Eventually I would like to build from the ground up to have the ability to fully customize my portfolio and add a dark mode toggle.  

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that the code base on tamplates is pretty dense. It allowed me to navigate through another developer's code and get a sense of how the files interacted with each other. It forced me to get reallll comfortable with the browser inspector tool and pick up on skills that I would otherwise ignore. 10/10 would do again.
